Manage your events and show them on your site.


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to to show a list of events with date, time, content, location, etc. on your site by using a shortcode or a widget.

= Current Features =
* Admin pages to view/create/manage/modify events
* Available event data fields: event title, event startdate, event enddate, event starttime, event location, event content
* Beginning and end dates for multi-day events
* Wordpress's WYSIWYG editor for the event content. So you can include styled text, links, images and other media in your events.
* A duplicate function for events to easier create similar event copies
* Import multiple events via csv files
* Event categories
* Sync event categories with post categories
* Filter events according to dates or categories
* Include an event feed in your site

= Usage: =
New events can be added in the WordPress admin area.

To display the events on your site simply insert the shortcode `[event-list]` into a page or post.
You can modify the listed events and their style with attributes. All available attributes can be found on the Event List -> About page in the Wordpress admin area.

Additionally there is also a widget available to show the upcoming events in your sidebar.

= Development: =
If you want to follow the development status have a look at the [git-repository on github](https://github.com/mibuthu/wp-event-list "wp-event-list git-repository").
Feel free to add your merge requests there, if you want to help to improve the plugin.

= Translations: =
Please help translating this plugin into multiple languages.
You can submit your translations at [transifex.com](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-event-list "wp-event-list at transifex").
There the source strings will always be in sync with the actual development version.


== Installation ==

The easiest version of installing is to go to the admin page. There you can install new plugins in the menu Plugins -> Add new. Search for "Event List" and press "Install now".

If you want to install the plugin manually download the zip-file and extract the files into your wp-content/plugins folder.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an event list to show up in a Page or Post on my site? =
Insert the shortcode [event-list] in your page or post. You can modify the output by many available shortcode attributes (see Event List -> About page for more infos).

= How do I use styled text and images in the event content? =
Event List uses the built-in Wordpress WYSIWYG editor. It's exactly the same process like in creating Posts or Pages.

= Can I call the shortcode directly via php e.g. for my own template, theme or plugin? =
Yes, you can create an instance of the "SC_Event_List" class which is located in the plugin folder under "includes/sc_event-list.php" and call the function show_html($atts). With $atts you can specify all the shortcode attributes you require.
Another possibility would be to call the wordpress function "do_shortcode()".
